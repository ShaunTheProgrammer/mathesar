# Users

Mathesar allows multiple users to collaborate on the same data using a [role-based permissioning](./permissions.md) system.

## Managing Users

1. Click on the gear icon on the top right of the application and select **Administration**.
1. In the left sidebar, click on **Users**.

!!! info "Admin-assigned passwords"
    Any user with an admin-assigned password (new or edited) will be prompted to change their password after logging in.

## Admin vs Standard users

Each Mathesar user is either **Admin** or **Standard**.

Admin users have the following capabilities which Standard users do not:

- Admins can can manage other Mathesar users (view, add, edit, delete).
- Admins can add and remove [Databases](./databases.md).
- Admins can manage [Collaborators](./permissions.md#collaborators). This allows an Admin user to grant any Mathesar user access to a database through a PostgreSQL role that the Admin specifies.

Upon installing Mathesar, your first user will be an Admin user.

## Users vs Roles

- A **"user"** is a Mathesar construct. Each Mathesar installation has multiple users.
- A **"role"** is a PostgreSQL construct ([docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/user-manag.html)). Each PostgreSQL server has multiple roles and multiple databases.

!!! caution "Why this distinction is important"
    Outside of Mathesar, it's not uncommon for people to say _user_ when referring to a PostgreSQL _role_. However, within the context of Mathesar users and roles are different things! Our documentation maintains this distinction pedantically.

How users and roles work together:

- To access a database, each Mathesar user must be assigned a PostgreSQL role to be used for that database.
- The user's permissions on actual data (in the [user database](./glossary.md#user-db)) are determined by the corresponding role's permissions within PostgreSQL.

    !!! info "Admin doesn't matter here"
        The user's "admin" status with Mathesar _has no effect_ on the user's ability to do things with the _data_ in a database! The admin status only affects operations on Mathesar's [internal database](./glossary.md#internal-db) such as managing collaborators and their corresponding roles.

- You can configure separate Mathesar users to share the same PostgreSQL role if you like. This is a good option if you want those users to have the same permissions on the data.
- Or you can use separate PostgreSQL roles for different users. This is necessary any time you want different users to have different permissions on the data.
- You cannot configure one Mathesar user with two PostgreSQL role simultaneously â€” though you can save multiple PostgreSQL roles in Mathesar and manually switch between them if necessary.

See [Permissions](./permissions.md) for more information on managing roles.

## Limitations

- Mathesar does not send invitation emails to new users (yet). You'll need to send the user their username and password yourself.
- Nor is there yet an email-based password recovery mechanism. If you are locked out of your Mathesar installation's web interface, your system administrator can still [use the command line reset any user's password](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6358030/how-to-reset-django-admin-password).
